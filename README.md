# Biodiversity-Dashboard

## Analysis:

The Biodiversity Dashboard has a variety of functionalities for our user-friendly platform that allows a multitude of data to be displayed by filtering the samples of the test subjects. Despite that, there is a limited amount of data. The basis on which this platform was built can serve far beyond its potential and, therefore, can help to identify an infinite amount of peopleâ€™s data. This data can be filtered even further as requested.  The Data also allows users to gain a leverage point of knowledge about the bacteria that have colonized their belly button so they can sell it to Improbable Beef.

## Summary 
This analysis will serve as a basis for future data and users that would like to sell their bacteria to Improbable Beef. The bacteria is ultimately used for the development of suitable options for synthetic beef. The visual aids create a fluid platform for choosing the right candidate.
